# ADS-Assignment-2

- `MyArrayList` and `MyLinkedList` implement the `myList` interface and provide basic operations on lists, such as adding, deleting, and accessing elements.
- `MyStack`, `myQueue` and `MyMinHeap` use `MyArrayList` and `MyLinkedList` to implement stack, queue and minimum heap respectively.
- All classes provide efficient operations for adding and removing elements using different approaches to data storage (arrays and doubly linked lists).
- Each class implements only its own functionality, without duplicating the code of other classes.
- Classes provide security against cyclic references in the `MyLinkedList` and efficient addition/removal of elements in the `MyArrayList' for all operations.
